# ⚡ create-aarambh-app

> Instantly scaffold a new Aarambh.js project using a pre-built template.

---

## 📦 Installation

Install the CLI tool globally using npm:

```bash
npm install create-aarambh-app
````

---

## 🚀 Usage

Create a new Aarambh.js project by running:

```bash
npx create-aarambh-app my-app
```


This will generate a new folder `my-app` using the template stored in the internal `template/` directory.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

After the command runs, your folder will look like this:

```
my-app/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── main.js
```

All files are copied from the built-in `template/` folder included in the CLI.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

* The CLI copies the contents of the `template/` folder.
* It renames and places them inside the folder name you provide (`my-app`).
* No additional configuration or setup required.
